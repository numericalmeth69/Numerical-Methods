- Eigen, a matrix library, downloadable from <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/>.
Eigen is released under the MPL v2. Eigen version 3.1.2 is included, unmodified
in the directory common/eigen3/. 

- "A C++ expression parser", downloadable from 
<http://www.speqmath.com/tutorials/expression_parser_cpp/index.html>.
This is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and included

made to fit the needs (e.g. to match the error handling of the rest of 
Pogo).
